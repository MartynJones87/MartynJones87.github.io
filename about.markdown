Hi, my name is Martyn. I am currently the Computer Science Technical Lead at [We Predict](https://www.wepredict.com).

My role covers a variety of different areas:

### SQL Server database administration and development

Everything from configuring new instances, writing and managing multi billion row ETL processes and writing stored procedures to perform complex data analysis. Most of the time I'm trying convince SQL Server to do something it wasn't really designed to do, in as fast a way as possible!

### C# application and web-application development

One day, this could be writing front-end TypeScript code for a ASP.Net Web application and the next, coding high performance command line applications to process billion row CSV files or handling hundreds of millions of data files.

### Systems and Network Administration

I'm part of the core team that manages the network and servers, so turn my hand to whatever situations arise.

I live just outside of [Swansea in Wales, UK](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Swansea/@51.6255141,-3.9655064,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x486e45555a4e97b1:0x3d77128e2fe7cb74!8m2!3d51.62144!4d-3.943646) with my wife and son and our dog, Bob and cat, Jasper.
